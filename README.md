Here's a simple `README.md` template you can use for your project. It includes sections like project description, setup instructions, and usage.


# Calculator Project

A simple calculator application built using Python and Tkinter.

## Description

This project implements a basic calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the **Tkinter** library in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

* Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, \*, /)
* Clear the display with the "C" button
* Evaluate and display the result with the "=" button
* User-friendly graphical interface built using Tkinter

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.

### Steps to Set Up

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd calculator
   ```

3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   * For **Windows**:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * For **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   (Note: Tkinter is generally included with Python, so it may not be needed as a separate install.)

## Usage

1. Run the calculator application.

   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

2. The graphical user interface (GUI) will open, and you can start using the calculator to perform calculations.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how you can perform an addition:

* Click `7`, then `+`, then `3`, and then click `=`.
* The result `10` will be displayed.
